# Voyatika OS - The Starship Orka Operating System

Welcome to the official repository of Voyatika OS, an immersive, interactive operating system designed for the fictional starship Orka. The name Voyatika is a creative blend of "Voyage" and the Greek adjective "Katikos" (Κατικός), which means "relating to travel" or "fit for a journey." This project is the culmination of my passion for both software development and the boundless possibilities of space exploration.

## My Journey to Voyatika OS

Creating Voyatika OS was a voyage of its own. I embarked on this project with a plethora of ideas, eager to create an operating system that would not only be functional but also an engaging part of the Orka's onboard experience. I started by jotting down features I envisioned for Voyatika OS. As deadlines loomed closer, I had to limit my ambitions, focusing on what was truly essential for launch while setting aside the stretch goals for future updates.

### Design and Development Odyssey

The blueprint of Voyatika OS began with wireframing in Figma, capturing the look and feel of the interface I dreamed of. This was a critical step in visualizing the user experience, guiding the aesthetic and functional design of the operating system. From there, I dived into the depths of database design, seeding it with data that would bring the Orka and its universe to life. However, this endeavor consumed more time than anticipated, leading to a race against time in the development of the front end.

Implementing user authorization was a crucial milestone, achieved with bcrypt for hashing, JSON Web Tokens for session management, and local storage for persistence. This foundation enabled me to focus on creating a dynamic and interactive UI, incorporating the dnd kit for the iconic draggable windows that define desktop operating systems.

### Built with the MERN Stack

Voyatika OS is powered by the MERN stack:

- **MongoDB** with Mongoose for database management
- **Express** for robust server routing
- **React** for a responsive front-end
- **Node.js** for scalable server-side logic

This technology stack was chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and to demonstrate newly attained knowledge, making it an ideal choice for building Voyatika OS.

### Features That Make Voyatika OS Unique

- **Custom Logo and Vaporwave Aesthetic**: Designed with Adobe Illustrator, the logo and retro vaporwave theme encapsulate the spirit of adventure and the digital frontier.
- **Crew Database**: Explore the crew of the Orka, with detailed profiles including photos and personal information.
- **Daily News App**: Powered by NASA's APOD API, discover a new story each day from the cosmos, with navigational buttons to explore past entries.
- **G-NAV (Galaxy Navigator)**: A galactic map offering a top-down view of the surrounding cosmos, with clickable planets revealing animated images and fascinating facts.
- **Tasker App**: A comprehensive task manager allowing users to track, complete, add, or delete tasks, embodying the functionality of a desktop OS with draggable icons and windows.

### The Voyage Ahead

While Voyatika OS has set sail, the journey is far from over. Current challenges, like the signup feature's malfunction and real-time task updating in the Tasker app, are waypoints on my development roadmap. Future updates will include:

- **3D Model Viewer**: Enabling users to explore the Orka in captivating 3D detail.
- **Military Info App**: Dive into the lore of different militaries within the Voyatika universe.
- **Enhanced UI Functionality**: Introducing window minimization, position saving, and more to enrich the desktop experience.
- **Calendar App and Music Player**: Adding personal and entertainment value to the OS.

## Your Role in the Voyatika Odyssey

Voyatika OS is not just my project; it's a portal for anyone who dreams that are often difficult to explain to others. I welcome contributors, feedback, and ideas that can help navigate this project to new horizons. Whether you're a fellow developer, a designer with a vision, or simply a space enthusiast, your insights can help shape the future of Voyatika OS.



### Getting Started: Accessing Voyatika OS

1. **Retrieve Your Access Credentials**: To explore Voyatika OS, you'll need a username and password. Currently, the user sign-up functionality is under maintenance, so please reach out to me directly to obtain your login details. I'm committed to responding promptly to ensure you can embark on your journey without delay.

### Navigating the Operating System

Voyatika OS is designed to mirror the intuitive, user-friendly interface of contemporary desktop operating systems, making it straightforward for anyone familiar with such environments.

- **Logging In**: Enter your username and password on the welcome screen. Upon successful login, you'll be greeted by the Voyatika OS desktop, a launchpad to discovery and functionality.

- **Interacting with the Desktop**: The desktop features draggable icons representing different applications and utilities of Voyatika OS. Here's how to interact with them:
  - **Click and Drag**: Just like a real OS, windows within Voyatika OS can be clicked and dragged across the screen. This allows you to organize your workspace efficiently.
  - **Double Click to Open**: To launch an application, simply double-click on its icon. Each application opens in a new window that can be moved or closed as needed.

- **Exploring Applications**: From the Crew Database to the G-NAV and Tasker App, each application is designed to enhance your experience and interaction with the Orka's digital ecosystem. The UI is intuitive, with navigational cues and interactions that will be familiar to anyone who has used a desktop OS.

### Administrative Actions and Permissions

Some actions within Voyatika OS, such as editing and deleting user information, are restricted to admin accounts. These functions are critical for maintaining the integrity and security of the operating system and are therefore not accessible to all users.
